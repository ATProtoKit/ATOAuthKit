# Conversion for `oauth-types/src/oauth-scope.ts`

## `export const oauthScopeSchema`

This has been converted.

Swift equivalent:

```swift
public struct OAuthScope: Codable, CustomStringConvertible
```

This has been converted into an `enum`.

In the future, `CharacterSet` may be used to check the scopes.
